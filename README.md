# overcooked2-experiment-repo

A lightweight Python-based implementation inspired by Toyoda-san's work, aiming to reproduce agent behavior in an Overcooked2-like environment.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
````

2. **Install the required packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set the Unity environment executable path or URL**
   In the code, locate the `env_url` variable and update it with the path or download link to the Unity environment executable (e.g., `.exe` file).

```

You can paste this directly into your `README.md`. Want me to include example paths or screenshots for clarity?
